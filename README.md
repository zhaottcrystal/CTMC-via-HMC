Summary
--------------------
Synthetic and real data for paper "User-friendly Bayesian analysis of continuous time Markov chains"

Introduction
-------------------
There are three folders in the repository. Each folder contains the data files for one section of the paper. The name of the folders is consistent with the section name in the paper. For example, folder "Sec7.3Accuracy" refers to the data that are used in Section 7.3 in the original paper. 

###Real Data Description-Sec7.5RealData
In this folder, "RealDataalignmenttotal.tx" refers to the alignment in the protein kinase domain family. The starting sequence is selected to be the kinase domain present in the mouse Titin protein taken from the PDB file 1TKI, which also includes some of the flanking sequence, along with the inclusion of the flanking sequence, allows for a more computationally feasible example. This alignment data contained 641 sequences and each sequence has 415 sites. "RealDatatree.nwk.txt" is the inferred unrooted phylogenetic tree using MrBayes which has a more complete and efficient set of tree resampling moves.
